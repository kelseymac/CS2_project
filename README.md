# Higher or Lower Card Game

This is a project created for a data structure class. 
The game is using a deck of cards from which the dealer takes four. 
The dealer then asks four questions:

* is the first card red or black
* is the second card higher or lower than the first card
* is the third card in between or outside of the first two cards' values
* and what is the suit of the fourth card

The user then can play again or end the game.
